    <h1>WHY YOU NEED A WEBSITE FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN <br> 2021</h1>
    <p>In the world today a lot of people say a website is a secondary option for them. 
        And it’s until clients start to ask before they see reasons why they should have one, 
        not knowing they are missing a lot of profit by not even having a website in the first place. 
        Let me show you some reasons.
    </p>
        <ul>
    <li class="blog-text">
        1. YOUR BUSINESS WILL GAIN CREDIBILITY <br>
        More and more people are searching online for things they want, for solutions to their problems, to compare prices, or just to get some information about a store, restaurant or business before they purchase from them. If you don’t have a website, potential customers will go to your competitors who do, especially if you are a home-based business without a bricks-and-mortar address.
        Having a website will not only provide the information they are looking for, but it will give your business credibility. It says I am here, I mean business, and I am in it for the long haul.
     </li>
    <li class="blog-text">
        2. A WEBSITE IS ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE <br>
        Unlike your brick-and-mortar location, which is only open a few hours a day, a website is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can provide both regular and prospective customers the convenience of reviewing your products and services when your store or office is closed.
        Not only that, with so many interactive features and add-ons available, visitors to your website can contact you, sign up for your courses, schedule appointments and even purchase directly through your website even when you’re away from your desk or after closing.
        With today’s busy lifestyles, this is a great selling point when making a purchase decision.
    </li>
    <li class="blog-text">
        3. A WEBSITE ENABLES YOU TO TARGET A WIDER AUDIENCE <br>
        Websites are accessible from anywhere in the world provided there is an internet connection. Since more and more people have access to the internet, even in remote locations, you can target a much wider audience if your business has a website.
        Whether you offer products or services, or you’re business or consumer based, your website provides you with an alternative location to sell. As a retailer, an eCommerce website is a great place to sell your products to a wider market. Think of all the people who can’t get to your bricks and mortar store that you could sell your products to.
        Even service-based businesses can offer their services globally through a website. Now that we have so many affordable ways to communicate with people, we can do business with anyone, anywhere, any time. A website makes it so much easier to attract clients from a global market.
    </li>
    <li class="blog-text">
        4. IT PROVIDES A MEDIUM TO SHOWCASE YOUR WORK <br>
        No matter what type of business you’re in, a website is a great place to showcase your work or demonstrate your skills. By including a portfolio, image gallery or videos, as well as testimonials about your work, you can demonstrate what makes your company or you unique.
        Back when I first wrote my original article, there was no Pinterest or Instagram. Now 9 years later, a lot of people are using these social media channels to showcase their work. But is your target audience on Pinterest or Instagram?
        On Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and other social media channels, the quality of your photos or graphics is compromised and the size may be substantially reduced. Not only that but Facebook and other social media channels control how people interact with them and even WHO can see them.
        If you have a website, your portfolio can be viewed by everyone anywhere and you are in control of what people see, the quality and size of your photos, and how people interact with those photos.
        Not only that, but did you know, in most cases, once you post your work on these social media channels you no longer own the rights to those photos and they could be being sold to use in those sponsored ads you see throughout your timeline?
    </li>

        5. FIRST IMPRESSION COUNTS <br>
        
        Let’s face it – we live in a world where people Google before they shop, 
        visit online review sites like Yelp before they buy and “check in” via Facebook as they go about their days.
        Because of this, you want your first impression to be the best it can be.
        Beginning with your website, consumers are passing judgment and making decisions about whether or not they will even visit your store, 
        restaurant or office. They’re likely to dismiss you entirely, as well, 
        should they believe your website doesn’t reflect the kind of experience your business – or a business like yours – should offer.
